In this program i have imported time module.The two main functions to undertand in this program is :
1)sleep():Which basically allows you bring a gap of one second for every iteration.
2)divmod():Which basically allows you to divide the input seconds into min:sec format like that of a usual timer.

In the code the countdown function has this while loop which runs until its value hasn't reached zero,allowing you to have a countdown timer for desired seconds.
